<h2>Ibotta</h2>

<p>Ibotta earns you cash rebates whenever you make a purchase at your local grocery store. You simply take a picture of your receipt and upload it through the app, and your Ibotta account will be credited accordingly.</p>

<p>Though not every item you purchase will go toward the rebate, many store brand items (and some national brands) are part of the deal. Using Ibotta will almost certainly net you hundreds of dollars over the course of a year. You can also join “teams” and earn more after you and your teammates reach certain purchasing milestones.</p>

<p>Ibotta partners with over 180 stores throughout the country, so you likely won’t have any trouble earning rebates while shopping at the grocery store you’ve always shopped at.</p>

<p>Ibotta offers a variety of methods for cashing out your earnings. You can receive actual money via Venmo or PayPal, or elect to be sent gift cards for various retailers.</p>

<p>In exchange for the rebates, you’ll have to deal with ads while using Ibotta. Probably nothing you’re not used to thanks to YouTube and popups, but just a little fair warning.</p>
